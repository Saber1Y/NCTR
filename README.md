## 🛠 Tech Stack

### Smart Contracts
- **Solidity** - Smart contract language
- **Foundry** - Development framework
- **OpenZeppelin** - Security-audited contract libraries
- **Polygon Mumbai** - Testnet deployment

### Frontend
- **Next.js 14** - React framework with App Router
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **Web3.js/Ethers.js** - Blockchain interaction
- **MetaMask** - Wallet integration

- **Social Media** - Live Twitter/X feed
- **News Feed** - RSS/JSON news aggregation
- **Responsive Design** - Mobile-first approach

## 🚦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn
- [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/) for smart contracts
- MetaMask browser extension
- Git

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd NECTR
```

### 2. Smart Contract Setup

```bash
cd contracts
forge install
forge build
forge test
```

### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 4. Deploy Smart Contract (Optional)

1. Get Polygon Mumbai testnet MATIC from [faucet](https://faucet.polygon.technology/)
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in contracts directory
3. Add your private key and RPC URL
4. Deploy:

```bash
cd contracts
forge script script/DeployNECTR.s.sol --rpc-url $POLYGON_MUMBAI_RPC_URL --broadcast
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### MetaMask Setup

1. Install MetaMask browser extension
2. Add Polygon Mumbai testnet:
   - Network Name: Mumbai Testnet
   - RPC URL: https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com
   - Chain ID: 80001
   - Currency Symbol: MATIC
   - Block Explorer: https://mumbai.polygonscan.com

### Environment Variables

Create `.env.local` in the frontend directory:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=your_deployed_contract_address
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID=80001
NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL=https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com
```

```

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm run test
```

## 📱 Demo Flow

1. **Connect Wallet**: Users connect MetaMask to the app
2. **View Balance**: See NECTR token balance and staked amount
3. **Stake Tokens**: Stake NECTR tokens to earn rewards
4. **Monitor Rewards**: View real-time reward accumulation
5. **Unstake**: Withdraw staked tokens plus earned rewards
6. **Social Feed**: Browse integrated Twitter/X content
7. **News Updates**: Read latest blockchain/crypto news

## 🔒 Security Note

⚠️ **This is a demonstration project** - not audited for production use.

Key simplifications for demo purposes:
- Basic access controls
- Simplified reward calculation
- No advanced security patterns
- Mock data for some features
